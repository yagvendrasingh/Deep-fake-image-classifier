Detecting deepfakes is a hard problem. Amateurish deepfakes can, of course, be detected by the naked eye. Other signs that machines can spot include a lack of eye blinking or shadows that look wrong. GANs that generate deepfakes are getting better all the time, and soon we will have to rely on digital forensics to detect deepfakes â€” if we can, in fact, detect them at all.

If we are unable to detect fake videos, we may soon be forced to distrust everything we see and hear, critics warn. The internet now mediates every aspect of our lives, and an inability to trust anything we see could lead to an "end of truth." This threatens not only faith in our political system, but, over the longer term, our faith in what is shared objective reality. If we can't agree on what is real and what is not, how can we possibly debate policy issues? alarmists lament.

At the end of the day, the hype around deepfakes may be the greatest protection we have. We are on alert that video can be forged in this way, and that takes the sting out of deepfakes.
